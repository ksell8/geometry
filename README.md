# Kurt's Geometry Study Guide

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a bridge between geometry topics
and computer science.  The study guide will be hosted on this site and
reference tools that can be built and used to understand these topics.
I am creating it in order to review and Geometry for the MTEL!

Tools are based on Qt Community Edition.  For this reason, the project is licensed under the LGPL.

I'm also interested in learning Lean for teaching proofwriting.
