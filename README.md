# Kurt's Geometry Study Guide

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a bridge between geometry topics
and computer science.  The study guide will be hosted on this site and
reference tools that can be built and used to understand these topics.
I am creating it in order to review and Geometry for the MTEL!
