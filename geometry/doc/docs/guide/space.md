# Space

Geometry is the study of space.  But what is space and how can we study it?
Space in our world has 3 dimensions.  If we lived in a world of 2 dimensional space,
we'd only be able to move up-down and side-to-side.  We'd also be flat.
Our third dimension is what gives us depth.

!!!abstract "Activity"

    Move your cursor around on the screen of your computer. Think about where the cursor is able 
    to move and where it cannot.  A computer screen is a two dimensional plane.

    Now stand up or get in your wheelchair.  Move around.  In what ways is your movement different
    from the cursor of your computer screen?  In what ways is it the same?  As a three dimensional
    being we are always operating in a three dimensional plane.

    If your wondering how you can percieve depth in computer graphs, that's a projection
    of depth.  If you've ever taken an art class, perhaps you've heard of the adage 
    to create depth by drawing objects meant to be further away as smaller, and closer items bigger.
    By doing this, you're simulating by third plane.

Euclid's geometry holds in all dimensions, but we'll be studying it in the 2nd and 3rd dimensions.
The 2nd and 3rd dimensions are the most intuitive to rationalize around because we work with both.

# Points

A point in space is the smallest portion of space that we can think about.  It only has a position 
in space. If you move away from that position, you are at a new point in space.  Therefore, a point has 
no width, height or depth.

A point is typically represented as an ordered pair.  Ordered because the order is key and pair because 
there are two values.  The first value in the pair represents where the point is located horizontally.
The second value represents where the point is located vertically.  

OK, cool, but located in respect to what?  Technically every point can be represented as (2,2) in respect
to some other point.  But describing every point in space as (2,2) doesn't show the relationship between
points.  In order to talk about points in relation to each other we have to choose a point they are 
measured in respect to.  This ensures each point is unique and allows us to distinguish between them.

In math we call this special point the origin.  And it is denoted by (0,0).  Each point to the left of the origin is
given a negative value for the 1st dimension and to the right positive.  Each point below the origin is given a negative
value for the 2nd dimension and above positive.

???+question "Question: Walking/Rolling Around School"
    === "Question"
        You start at the front entry of school.
        You move 3 units to the left and 10 units forward.
        Then you move 5 units to the right and 15 units forward.
        Then you move 15 units to the left and 2 units backward.
        Where are you in respect to the entry door?
    === "Answer"
        Let's set the front door as the origin (0,0).
        3 units to the left is -3 and 10 units forward is +10.  So we are now at (0-3,0+10)=(-3,10).
        5 units to the right is +5 and 15 units forward is +15. So we are now at (-3+5,10+15)=(2,25).
        15 units to the left is -15 and 2 units backwards is -2.  So we are now at (2-15,25-2)=(-13,23).
        (-13,23), 13 units left, 25 units forward.

???+question "Question: Maps"
    === "Question"
        Maps help us talk about space and reason about how to move from one point to another.  Ordered pairs
        on maps are called coordinates measured in degrees.  Why why break up the spherical Earth in degrees will make more
        sense when we go over the unit circle. The origin for map coordinates are defined by two lines called axes. 
        Horizontal axes are called latitude and vertical axes are called longitude. 
        What is the line at 0 degrees longitude called?  What is the line at 0 degrees latitude called?
        What is the origin of a map?
    === "Answer & Trivia"
        The equator is at 0 degrees latitude and the prime meridian is at 0 degrees longitude.  Where they meet
        is the origin.

        The world isn't a perfect sphere.  So there is no perfect midpoint.  Therefore, over the years multiple prime meridians
        have been used.  Often a meridian would be chosen based on what made the most sense for the area being mapped.
        As we became more connected as a society and started to use standardized maps there was a need to
        standardize the prime meridian.  Today's prime meridian standard was established in 1884 at the International Meridian Conference in Washington, D.C.. The conference was called by the 21st President of the United States, Chester Arthur, and 25 nations attended. The delegates voted to make the Greenwich Meridian the prime meridian, with 22 countries in favor, San Domingo against, and France and Brazil abstaining.
        The Greenwich Meridian was chosen mainly due to British colonialism making the British standard the most prevelant.

# Lines

A line is defined by two distinct points.  

# Angles

# Planes

A plane is defined by two distinct lines.  A plane you may be familiar with from Algebra, is the coordinate plane.
