# Welcome to Kurt's Geometry Study Guide

For full documentation and associated tooling visit [the github project](https://github.com/ksell8/geometry).

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a bridge between geometry topics
and computer science.  The study guide will be hosted on this site and
reference tools that can be built and used to understand these topics.
I am creating it in order to review and Geometry for the MTEL!
